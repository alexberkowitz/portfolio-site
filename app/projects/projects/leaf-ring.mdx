I was incredbily honored to be given the opportunity to design a wedding band for a close friend. The custom, one-of-a-kind ring was designed by me and 3D printed/cast by [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/).

The ring was designed to match the bride's engagement ring, a family heirloom. I took inspiration from a leaf pattern inscribed on the engagement ring and applied a similar pattern to ths groom's band.
