In mid 2020, I began volunteering for [FairVote Illinois](https://www.fairvoteillinois.org/), an organization that is working to get ranked choice voting (RCV) implemented in Illinois. As part of my push to bring the organization's visual and digital presence to the next level, I created an a video that highlights some of the benefits of RCV and explains how it works in a simple manner. The goal was to present the problem, explain the solution, and highlight the differences clearly in two minutes or less (the resulting video ended up being 1:30, which is even better for sharing on social media and including in presentations).
