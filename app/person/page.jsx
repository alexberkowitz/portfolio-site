          For all of the love that I hold for digital content creation, I also really, really enjoy making real, physical products. I have an extensive history as an amateur maker & product designer. I&lsquo;ve designed products for companies, such as the Mercury Knife for Kizer, as well as for myself. I&lsquo;m well-versed in CAD/CAM, 3D printing, CNC machining, and a whole slew of other manufacturing processes ranging from DIY to industrial.
